# Real-Time Notification System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive real-time notification system implemented for the FeedbackFlow platform. The system provides instant alerts, email notifications, SMS messaging, and real-time dashboard updates to keep users informed of important feedback events.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **WebSocket Service** (`server/websocket.ts`)
   - Manages real-time connections with tenant isolation
   - Handles authentication and subscription management
   - Provides connection health monitoring and cleanup

2. **Alert Rule Engine** (`server/alertRuleEngine.ts`)
   - Evaluates feedback against configurable rules
   - Supports multiple condition types (rating thresholds, keywords, volume, time-based)
   - Implements cooldown periods and priority management

3. **Email Service** (`server/emailService.ts`)
   - SendGrid integration with HTML templates
   - Queue management with retry logic
   - Delivery tracking and statistics

4. **SMS Service** (`server/smsService.ts`)
   - Twilio integration with template support
   - Opt-in/opt-out management
   - Delivery tracking and compliance

5. **React WebSocket Hook** (`client/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`)
   - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Event handling and error management
   - Connection state management

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# SendGrid Configuration
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
FROM_EMAIL=alerts@yourdomain.com
FROM_NAME=Your Company Name

# Twilio Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid

- `alert_notifications` - Generated alert notifications
- `multimedia_files` - Voice recordings and images

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Alert Rule

```typescript
const alertRule = {
  name: "Low Rating Alert",
  description: "Trigger when customer gives rating below 3 stars",
  tenantId: "tenant-uuid",
  conditions: [
    {
      type: "rating_threshold",
      operator: "less_than",
      field: "overallRating",
      value: 3
    }
  ],
  actions: [
    {
      type: "email",
      recipients: ["manager@company.com"],
      template: "low-rating-alert"
    },
    {
      type: "sms",
      phoneNumbers: ["+1234567890"],
      template: "critical-alert"
    }
  ],
  priority: "high",
  isActive: true,
  cooldownPeriod: 30
};
```

### WebSocket Connection

```typescript
const { isConnected, sendMessage } = useWebSocket({
  tenantId: "tenant-uuid",
  userId: "user-uuid",
  onMessage: (event) => {
    switch (event.type) {
      case 'feedback':
        console.log('New feedback:', event.data);
        break;
      case 'alert':
        console.log('New alert:', event.data);
        break;
    }
  }
});
```
