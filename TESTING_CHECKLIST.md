## 🚀 SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Set DATABASE_URL environment variable
export DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_string"

# Run database migration
npm run db:push
```

### 2. Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for Google Cloud Storage
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
GOOGLE_CLOUD_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_client_email

# For file storage
PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR=/your-bucket-name/private
PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS=/your-bucket-name/public
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 📱 MOBILE TESTING

### Voice Recording on Mobile
1. Open feedback form on mobile device
2. Tap "Start Recording" button
3. Grant microphone permissions
4. Speak for 10-30 seconds
5. Tap "Stop Recording"
6. Verify audio plays back correctly
7. Check upload progress
8. Verify file appears in dashboard

### Image Upload on Mobile
1. Open feedback form on mobile device
2. Tap "Add Photos" button
3. Select multiple images from gallery
4. Verify image previews appear
5. Check upload progress

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues
1. **Voice recording not working**: Check microphone permissions
2. **Image upload failing**: Verify file size and type restrictions
3. **Upload progress not showing**: Check network connectivity
4. **Files not appearing**: Verify database connection and storage setup

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check database connection
npm run db:push

# Check environment variables
echo $DATABASE_URL
echo $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID

# Check server logs
npm run dev
```
